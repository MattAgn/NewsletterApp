A good rule of thumb is to multiply the size of the image you display\n * by the pixel ratio.\n *\n * ```\n * var image = getImage({\n *   width: PixelRatio.getPixelSizeForLayoutSize(200),\n *   height: PixelRatio.getPixelSizeForLayoutSize(100),\n * });\n * <Image source={image} style={{width: 200, height: 100}} />\n * ```\n *\n * ## Pixel grid snapping\n *\n * In iOS, you can specify positions and dimensions for elements with arbitrary\n * precision, for example 29.674825. But, ultimately the physical display only\n * have a fixed number of pixels, for example 640×960 for iPhone 4 or 750×1334\n * for iPhone 6. iOS tries to be as faithful as possible to the user value by\n * spreading one original pixel into multiple ones to trick the eye. The\n * downside of this technique is that it makes the resulting element look\n * blurry.\n *\n * In practice, we found out that developers do not want this feature and they\n * have to work around it by doing manual rounding in order to avoid having\n * blurry elements. In React Native, we are rounding all the pixels\n * automatically.\n *\n * We have to be careful when to do this rounding. You never want to work with\n * rounded and unrounded values at the same time as you're going to accumulate\n * rounding errors. Having even one rounding error is deadly because a one\n * pixel border may vanish or be twice as big.\n *\n * In React Native, everything in JavaScript and within the layout engine works\n * with arbitrary precision numbers. It's only when we set the position and\n * dimensions of the native element on the main thread that we round. Also,\n * rounding is done relative to the root rather than the parent, again to avoid\n * accumulating rounding errors.\n *\n */\nclass PixelRatio {\n  /**\n   * Returns the device pixel density.
